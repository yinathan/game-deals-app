### Future Enhancements

I hope to add a wider range of stores to search for, which will increase how many games the user is able to search for. Also, currently the search function will run the API many times (depending on how many games are searched) and will eventually give the user a CORS error. The timer on this is usually around 60 minutes and the user will be able to search again.
